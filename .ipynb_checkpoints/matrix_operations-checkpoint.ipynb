    "A vector is a way to express many physical quantities such as displacement, velocity, force, momentum, heat flux, and many more. Each of the listed quantities has a magnitude, but they also have directions. The image below shows a basic depiction of a two-dimensional vector. In three-dimensions the vector, $ \\vec A $ is:\n",

    "$ \\large \\vec A = A_x \\hat i + A_y \\hat j + A_z \\hat k $ \n",

    "To find the magnitude of a vector:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Adding and Subtracting\n",
    "We often to need to manipulate and use vectors in calculations. One of the simplest operations is *adding or subtracting vectors*. To do this the two vectors to be added or subtracted need to have the same number of elements, *n*. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Dot Product / Scalar Product\n",
    "Getting a *dot or scalar product*, in graphical terms, is like projecting one vector on another... the scalar result will be how much of one vector is going in the same direction as another. This is depicted below:\n",
